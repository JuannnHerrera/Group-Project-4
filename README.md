## Project Description
In this project, we investigate the rates of global theft and cybercrime. Our aim is to determine which countries have the most and fewest incidences of theft and cybercrime. Additionally, we will use machine learning to predict which countries will experience the most and least growth in theft and cybercrime rates in the future. We will ensure the credibility of our datasets and generate visualizations based on our findings using Python and ClickUp.

## Research Questions
1. Which countries have the highest and lowest theft rates?
2. Which countries have the highest and lowest cybercrime rates?
3. Which countries will have the most and least growth in theft and cybercrime rates?
